# EnptMES: Simple Text Encryption and Decryption Tool

EnptMES is a straightforward text encryption and decryption tool built with Python and Tkinter. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to securely encode and decode messages using a simple secret key. This project is ideal for beginners looking to explore the basics of encryption, decryption, and GUI development in Python.

## Features

- **Text Encryption**: Encode your messages with base64 encryption using a secret key.
- **Text Decryption**: Decode the encrypted messages back to their original form using the same secret key.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy text input and output.
- **Reset Functionality**: Quickly clear all input fields to start a new encryption or decryption process.
- **Password Protection**: Ensure the security of your messages with a basic password check.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EnptMES.git
   cd EnptMES
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python enptmes.py
   ```

3. **Encrypt a Message**:
   - Enter the text you wish to encrypt in the provided text box.
   - Enter the secret key (`1234`) in the key field.
   - Click on the `ENCRYPT` button to view the encrypted message.

4. **Decrypt a Message**:
   - Enter the encrypted text in the provided text box.
   - Enter the secret key (`1234`) in the key field.
   - Click on the `DECRYPT` button to view the decrypted message.

5. **Reset the Fields**:
   - Click the `RESET` button to clear all input fields and start over.
